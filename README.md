Synthetic Dataset to Study Changes in Water ConsumptionPatterns

This repository aims to provide tools for data simulation, focusing on the simulation of water consumption data, but it can be used in several areas. Here is provided the code to generate random time series, using probabilistic distributions such as Weibull, gamma, log-normal and log-logistic.
